# Si Rene App

Si Rene is a one-stop emergency app. It provides a faster way for users to call and track services in moments of emergency by eliminating call centers as intermediaries. Users only need to tap a button and speak of their emergency â€“ all other information like location and user identity are automatically relayed to the service.

Technologies used `Flutter` `Firebase` `Google Maps API` `Node.js` `Google Cloud Platform`
